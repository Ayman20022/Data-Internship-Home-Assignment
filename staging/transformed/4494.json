We are specifically looking for candidates who have worked on language generation, information retrieval, or reinforcement learning problems.\nGlimpse.ai is looking for someone who thinks artificial intelligence is AWESOME.\nWhat we are doing now:\nWe are a profitable and stable artificial intelligence startup that is building a tool that automatically writes content about any subject with the same level of quality, factual accuracy, and usefulness as a human.\nWhat we are building towards:\nOur goal is two parts:\nPart one: Develop strong AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is smarter than a human.\nPart two: Do this\nwithout\nselling our souls to venture capitalists or outside investors who will be more focused on Q4 profit, than on making sure this technology creates a profoundly better society.\nHow we plan on getting towards that goal:\nGlimpse.ai is entirely self-funded and is already profitable by selling awesome artificial intelligence products. We want to continue to advance artificial intelligence through sustainable, iterative, and self-funded improvements so that we can eventually reach our end goal while remaining independent and principled.\nWe have a product roadmap where we create and deliver products that our users love, with the requirement that everything we work on is furthering our research and understanding of complicated artificial intelligence concepts.\nWhat you will be doing:\nWe currently sell a product that generates content based on user input using large transformer networks. Our customers love the product, the content looks and reads well, but still is lacking in factual accuracy and relevance.\nYou will be working directly with the Founder & CEO (who is leading the artificial intelligence team, both as a manager and as an individual contributor) and other Machine Learning Engineers to bridge this gap and build a product that is able to generate high quality, factually relevant and interesting content about any keyword that a user inputs.\nThis will involve training new models and making improvements to existing ones. You will constantly be ingesting research papers, finding and implementing ways to take what is cutting edge, and writing production code to apply it to our goals. You will be analyzing where our current methods are falling short and devising and implementing ways to improve and iterate.\nWhat you\u2019ll mainly be working in:\nPyTorch (Hugging Face Transformers)\nWhat we want from you:\nYou read this job posting and mission statement and found it to be inspiring\nYou have multiple years of experience (professional or research) directly working with transformers to solve natural language generation or information retrieval problems\nYou are up to date on state of the art research in natural language generation and/or information retrieval\nYou can immediately contribute research direction and implementation on how to use deep learning and transformers to write higher quality and more factually accurate articles\nYou are an awesome developer with a very strong Computer Science (or very similar) background\nYou take immense pride in the work you do and think you are exceptional\nYou want to be contributing ideas, values, thoughts, and direction (we are a small company, and your boss is the Founder/CEO, so we want people who want to make a mark on our direction and vision!)\nSome benefits of working at Glimpse.ai include:\nGenerous salary \u2013 We would rather have one superstar than two mediocre players\nEquity - Ownership in what you are creating at a fast growing startup\nPremium benefits \u2013 Completely paid health coverage, 401k, profit sharing, gym membership, and more\nOffices located on the water in Baltimore\u2019s beautiful Fells Point district\nFreedom of working at a small company \u2013 you will report directly to the CEO\nThe excitement of a startup with the stability of a profitable company\nWe work on interesting problems that push the envelope in AI", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-16T19:36:27.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Glimpse.ai", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/glimpse-ai"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
