Sadly, they have few options. Most banks and financial institutions don\u2019t make any material effort to address this situation because it\u2019s not profitable for them to do so. Poor credit or a lack of credit history can create major barriers to renting an apartment or getting certain jobs, let alone buying a car or house.
