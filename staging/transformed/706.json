From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of\njoe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long\npaper trail and a series of truck deliveries.\nWith a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily\nworkflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s\nservices, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah\neliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers.\nPartnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley\nuser experience to an industry that hasn\u2019t evolved in decades.
