Here's a little about us, a little about what we believe, and what we are looking for.\nPodsights is an industry-leading attribution platform for podcast advertising. We handle over 10 billion events a month and we likely work with some of your favorite brands and publishers.\nOur mission is simple, we are looking to grow the podcast industry. Far too many brands try a podcast advertising campaign and churn. Or worse: they don\u2019t even try to enter the market. By providing a platform for brands to optimize results, we encourage investment in podcast advertising, and by proxy to publishers.\nThe podcasting industry has seen a lot of growth in the past few years, and we believe it has more room to grow. Beyond growth, podcasting presents some interesting problems: its decentralized, RSS-based nature, and the various ways people can listen. Joining Podsights is an excellent opportunity to be hands-on with an evolving medium.\nWe believe that where you went to school has little bearing on your performance as a software engineer. Where you live isn\u2019t a proxy for talent (we're fully remote and the team lives all over the place-- one of us even lives in Spain)! Your current employer provides a low signal about your future potential.\nDifferent backgrounds bring different perspectives, and we believe this helps us be better problem solvers. We encourage applications from all sorts of diverse backgrounds.\nAt Podsights, we look for ambition and curiosity. We love engineers that aren\u2019t solely interested in the craft of developing software. Want to start a company of your own one day? If yes, we want to talk. Are you interested in the business side of software? Tell us more.\nWe want curious engineers. You take things apart and see how they work (the real test is if you can put them together too!).\nOur team consists of members of Embedly (acquired by Medium), Horizon Media, Claritas, NPM, and How Stuff Works. You can learn more about us here:\u00a0https://podsights.com/team\nWe've got benefits too:\nCompetitive compensation and a 401K program\nFully remote role with an annual WFH stipend\nWe cover 100% of health benefits (medical, dental, and vision)\nWe offer 4 weeks of PTO each year\nA generous maternity/paternity leave policy\nAbout the Role\nYour role will focus on our Django application with some projects dipping into the data or the front end. On a given day, you might be creating new data models, adding an endpoint to our API, or working with our data pipelines. The benefit of joining a small team is you will have a tremendous impact on the company's direction and, to some extent, the industry.\nRequirements\n2+ years of experience as a backend or data engineer\nProficiency with Python or a similar language\nFamiliarity with SQL and NoSQL data structures\nDjango, Flask, or a similar web framework\nBonus\nDjango ORM\nGraphQL (Graphene)\nCloud infrastructure (GCP preferred)\nData and ETL platforms (Airflow, Dataflow, and BigQuery preferred)\nIf the above interests you, drop us a note.
