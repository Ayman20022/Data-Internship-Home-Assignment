But we also do quite a bit of research to stay up to date with the latest technologies/algorithms.\nWe are very collaborative; you will likely get lots of ideas from the team.\nWhat kind of problems do we solve?\nOur locomotives stream 350+ sensor information in real-time. We create predictive models to predict various component failures hours, days, and sometimes months in advance.\nThere are high-frame cameras beside our tracks, capturing images of trains and rail cars as they pass. We design various Deep Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to detect certain objects of interest or issues and defects. We then optimize their performance and deploy them at the edge for real-time scoring and notification of our mechanical personnel upon detections.\nWant to learn more? Apply today!\nWhat tools do we use?\nWe use Python, R, and Spark (PySpark, SparkR) for modeling and EDA.\nYou will have a local machine with 512GB of memory, so feel free to load the data in memory if it makes sense or if it fits (!)\nYou will also have terabytes of memory in our Spark cluster that is not shared by anyone.\nWe use Jupyter notebook, Emacs, PyCharm, Rstudio as IDEs.\nWe use Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet for Deep Learning, and OpenCV for traditional Computer Vision.\nWe always have the latest versions of our tools/packages/libraries available.\nWhat are our requirements?\nBachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Machine Learning, Statistics or related field\nMinimum of 1 year of relevant exp", "employment_type": "CONTRACTOR", "date_posted": "2021-07-12T16:39:05.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Open Systems Inc.", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-systems-inc"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": 12, "seniority_level": "Junior"}}
