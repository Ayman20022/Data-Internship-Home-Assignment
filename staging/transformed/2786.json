To make it work, it\u00a0has to\u00a0be clear where to focus.\nLineup.ai is a sophisticated digital tool that interprets contextual data to accurately predict how busy a restaurant will be \u2014 today, next week, or in three weeks. In partnership with best-in-class restaurants, and leveraging advanced machine learning models, the team at Lineup.ai has developed a solution by rooting our innovation efforts in our purpose \u2013 to help our customers mitigate risk and uncertainty. By considering multiple key factors that affect demand, Lineup.ai increases confidence and consistency in a manager\u2019s decisions.\nOur easy-to-use software shows executives and managers exactly what they need to make better, faster decisions toward increasing efficiency and improving profitability. We\u2019ve built a custom prediction engine tailored to each store\u2019s specific geography, weather, and local events. Lineup.ai is up and running in multiple pilot locations, enabling continued iteration of the key features and refinement of the predictive model.\nWhat You Will Do:\nExperiment with\u00a0a variety of\u00a0machine learning\u00a0algorithms to build, test, and refine\u00a0predictive models for restaurant sales, labor, and inventory\nIdentify and experiment with new data sources\u00a0to increase\u00a0the\u00a0predictive\u00a0power of our products\nDesign and develop incremental model improvements and data acquisition strategies\nDevelop monitoring\u00a0metrics to reflect real-world model performance and make recommendations to shape the future direction of models and digital solutions\nCollaborate with\u00a0Product, UX, and the leadership team\u00a0to understand\u00a0business\u00a0requirements and prioritize\u00a0solution\u00a0development\nCollaborate with ML Engineer to determine how to best\u00a0operationalize and\u00a0scale solutions\nPartner with\u00a0ML Engineer\u00a0and\u00a0the 1848 Ventures Data Science Practice Group\u00a0to create more robust features and algorithms\u00a0as well as develop shared best practices and broadly reusable components\nHow You Will Get Here:\nCommercial experience applying data and machine learning to drive generate business value\nA track record of designing and implementing time-series algorithms\u00a0(forecasting)\nExperience operationalizing models\u00a0in a three-tiered environment\u00a0(dev, test, prod)\nA demonstrated ability to\u00a0communicate\u00a0technical findings\u00a0to\u00a0a non-technical audience\nA demonstrated ability to dive deep and solve new complex problems but the discernment to know when, and how deep to dive (progress over perfection; value driven)\nHigh levels of competence with\u00a0Python\nHigh levels of competence with SQL\nA high-level understanding of data architecture and database design\nProficient with a wide variety of machine learning and data munging libraries and tools (e.g.\u00a0NumPy, scikit-learn,\u00a0PyTorch,\u00a0xgboost, etc.)\nPrior experience working with data engineers, software engineers, and dev ops teams to set up appropriate technical resources to perform Data Science work and translating prototypes to production\nProficiency with at least one cloud-based platform (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure)\nNice To Haves:\nPrior experience implementing deep learning algorithms\nExperience with DAG / workflow orchestration tools (e.g.\u00a0Airflow, Prefect)\nExperience writing unit tests\nExperience with other general-purpose programming languages", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-30T16:07:47.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Lineup.ai", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/lineupai"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
