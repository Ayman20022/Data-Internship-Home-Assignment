We need engineers who are comfortable with pre-production work, rather than working on existing systems.\nDescription:\nWe are looking for a\nmachine learning engineer with a focus on rapid prototyping and pre-production development to build innovative solutions for the Productivity team\n. The ML Engineer will become an integral part of the Productivity and D10X team. Our teams work with businesses to solve hard problems that require experimentation, an outside-in perspective, and experience navigating ambiguity.\nJob Background/context:\nThe objective of the job is to create, experiment, and put in place rapid prototypes and initial MVPs where solution hypothesis generation and testing is done with tangible throwaway proofs-of-concept and rapidly implemented solutions. We expect that much of the work will require\nan application of machine learning aimed at process automation, but will likely also involve elements of data engineering, back-end development, and process/systems mapping and design.\nYou should be a jack of all trades with a well-rounded set of programming skills and data science/data engineering knowledge, with experience in pre-production development. You should have an interest in understanding why a software feature has business value \u2013 and want to know the customer journey that is being addressed to ensure you are building the right thing in the right way. Versatility is key, as every project will require a different approach- sometimes including non-technical work like process mapping or data gathering.\nThis job will require a high degree of independence, curiosity, initiative, and comfort with \u201cgood enough\u201d over perfection.
