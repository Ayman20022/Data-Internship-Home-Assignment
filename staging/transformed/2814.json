The Core ML team works with a simple mission of making it easy to use machine learning at Robinhood. The team is executing the mission by building the core infrastructure (eg. training and serving platform, feature platform) and a number of model-as-a-service solutions (eg. embedding service, multi-arm bandit service). The team works closely with data scientists who are applying ML in various spaces such as risk and fraud, growth, customer understanding etc. to ensure that they are able to ship their solutions to create business value.\nAs a\nmachine learning engineer focused on applied ML\n, you will work closely with other teams to identify critical problems that can be solved using ML. You will co-develop a model, sometimes an ML system, with them and then, whenever possible, build and deploy the solution as a reusable and generalizable ML service. You will continue to build such services and onboard new applications to existing services over time.\nWhat You\u2019ll Do Day To Day\nDive into data to understand business problems that may benefit from ML\nTrain novel machine learning models and take them to production\nInvest in feature engineering and model hyper-parameter tuning to improve predictive power and performance of the models\nAfter deployment, closely monitor the model and take recourse to model interpretability to understand how its impacts on users\nWork cross-functionally with data scientists, product managers, operations, and other engineering teams to build generalizable and reusable models\nCollaborate with our data infrastructure teams to build highly scalable services and systems\nPresent ML success stories to internal and external audiences\nSurvey the latest and greatest in various areas of ML and bring the benefits of those to the firm whenever possible\nAbout You\n3+ years of experience as machine learning engineer or applied machine learning scientist\nGraduate degree in a quantitative field such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, engineering or natural sciences and some experience in software engineering in a production environment\nSolid understanding of machine learning and deep learning algorithms\nExperience of working with large, noisy and highly imbalanced datasets\nExperience of building and shipping ML models that are aligned with product roadmap\nExcellent programming skills, including proficiency in Python\nPassion for working and learning in a fast-growing company\nExcellent communication skills to tell a story through data.\nExperience of building relationships and influencing stakeholders across multiple discipline\nBonus Points\nIndustry experience of delivering business impact with ML models or systems\nResearch and publication experience in any field of machine learning\nProof of excellence in Kaggle or similar forums\nTechnologies We Use\nPython\nScikit-learn\nTensorflow or Pytorch\nKubernetes\nKafka\nFeeling ready to give 100% to democratizing finance for all?
