We have received a National Science Foundation SBIR grant to do research on computer vision for understanding plant geometry. This is a challenging problem in farm fields where many plants can overlap and occlude one another. We\u2019re looking for a remote software developer to help with building and running the software involved in this research. The grant period is 9 months, but if the project goes well there is a good chance that the work will continue after that.\nRequirements:\nexperience with C++\nexperience with Python\nexperience with image processing and/or computer vision algorithms\nexperience with PyTorch and/or TensorFlow\nbased in US\nOptional:\nexperience with developing and running machine learning models on AWS\nexperience with OpenCV\nTo apply: please send a resume along with a link to some C++ and/or Python code that you have written.\nCompensation: $117k/year (for 9 months) plus health insurance", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-10T00:25:00.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Modular Science", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/modular-science"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
