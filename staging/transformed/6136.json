Our platform enables organizations to license their providers in new states, verify existing credentials, and get in-network with insurance payers.

Our web platform and API provide a robust (and, dare we say, delightful!) abstraction over hundreds of healthcare systems, processes, and protocols from medical and insurance bodies across the US. This abstraction is brought to life by a suite of data integrations, web crawlers, and backend intelligence that turns crucial but complicated, manual processes into automated, turn-key solutions, critical to the growth of our customers.\nMedallion is built by a small, distributed team of seasoned product-minded engineers with decades of experience across startups and public companies alike. We pride ourselves on our level of product ownership (we don\u2019t have a PM yet!); respect and trust for each other; and an ability to execute extremely fast on new ideas.\nWe've raised $20M from some of the best investors like Spark Capital, Optum Ventures, Elad Gil, Peter Reinhardt, and many others.\nResponsibilities\nCollaborate with other engineers to build core infrastructure and features (develop web apps, write backend services, organize data stores, orchestrate cloud tools, and more).\nWork with internal and external stakeholders to discover and design new product features\nParticipate in (and influence) sprint planning, roadmap development, and other team processes\nHelp build an awesome company :)\nRequirements\n2+ years of experience working on software teams\nProficiency with a general-purpose backend language \u2013 Python, Go, Ruby, Java, etc.\nComfort with backend systems \u2013 web applications, databases, cloud infrastructure, etc.\nComfort with Javascript (or an appetite to learn)\nA desire for ownership, impact, and growth", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Medallion", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/medallion-credentials"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": 24, "seniority_level": "Mid-Level"}}
