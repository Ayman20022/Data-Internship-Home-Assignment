The division\u2019s primary focus is maintaining and upgrading the subsystems supporting the operation of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. The major subsystems include: telescope monitor and control, telescope scheduling, data reduction, and data archiving. The team also develops new software to meet challenges posed by new observing paradigms and state of the art instrumentation.  Job classification and compensation will be commensurate with education and experience. The position is based at the GBO in Green Bank WV. Requests for occasional telework may be considered.\nIn addition to competitive pay, GBO provides excellent paid time off benefits (vacation and sick leave). Medical, dental and vision plans are effective first day of employment. GBO\u2019s retirement benefit contributes an amount equal to 10 percent of a qualified participant\u2019s base pay. No contribution is required of the employee; we also offer an optional supplemental, tax-deferred plan for employee retirement contributions.\nESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nUsing prescribed methods, researches, conducts or coordinates detailed phases of software engineering work as assigned. Performs work that involves conventional software engineering practices.  The successful candidate will collaborate with members of the Software, Electronics and Science Divisions to contribute to full life cycle development of systems-oriented applications supporting GBO operations. Opportunities exist to develop software in other radio astronomy-related domains including embedded systems, FPGA systems, and machine learning.\nDesigns, develops, implements, and supports mission critical software applications and mechanical control systems with minimal supervision.\nParticipates in documentation, installation, testing, maintenance support and further development of software subsystems within established standards.\nWorks with other software engineers, electronics engineers, and scientists to identify and solve problems.\nAssists in preparing costs and time analyses of projects.
