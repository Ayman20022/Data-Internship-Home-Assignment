We are here to be a part of this change. Every reinvention begins with a blank sheet of paper, and a willingness to reason from first principles.\nThis is where Prediction Machine enters the picture. Our first move in this direction was a global search for talent. To paraphrase Elon Musk, we are building the team that will build the solution.\nOur goal is to ship investment strategies that outperform because they leverage unusual data, or usual data in an unusual way, and rely on massive computational abilities to make plausible, sample-efficient estimates.\nSee more about us at https://www.predmachine.com\nAs a quant or a data scientist, you are expected to bring strong experience in building and deploying scalable machine learning algorithms. You will work with a team of motivated individuals on building trading algorithms and strategies, while being responsible for monitoring the health of your deployed algorithms. You will be expected to rigorously test your models for data integrity, statistical significance and numerical stability.\nYou are someone with;\n3+ years of experience in Python, SQL, machine learning\nMachine Learning training/inference with GPUs is a plus\n3+ years of experience in data processing libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy and pyAthena\n3+ years of experience in REST APIs, Flask, FastAPI\n2+ years of experience in AWS or any other cloud computing platform\nPrior experience in machine learning with large scale time series/financial/quantitative datasets\nStrong demonstrated experience in deployment grade machine learning\nPrior experience in assessing code quality and building machine learning codebase with proper engineering fundamentals\nExposure to interdisciplinary collaboration, especially involving domain expertise\nExperience with AWS Athena and Redshift is a plus\nKnowledge of Pyspark or other distributed computing frameworks is a plus\nStrong oral and written communication skills\nCapacity to operate independently and make sense of limited directions, especially capable to identify the underlying unknowns", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-20T20:40:58.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Prediction Machine LLC", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/prediction-machine"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": 36, "seniority_level": "Mid-Level"}}
