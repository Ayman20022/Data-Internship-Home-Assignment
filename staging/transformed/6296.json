Owns delivery of project activity and tasks assigned by others. Supports process updates and changes. Solves business issues.\nData Source Identification: Understand the appropriate data set required to develop simple models by developing initial drafts. Supports the identification of the most suitable source for data. Maintains awareness of data quality.\nData Strategy: Understands, articulates, and applies principles of the defined strategy to routine business problems that involve a single function.\nAnalytical Modeling: Selects the analytical modeling technique most suitable for the structured, complex data and develops custom analytical models. Conducts exploratory data analysis activities (for example, basic statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, statistical inferences) on available data. Defines and finalizes features based on model responses and introduces new or revised features to enhance the analysis and outcomes. Identifies the dimensions of the experiment, finalizes the design, tests hypotheses, and conducts the experiment. Perform trend and cluster analysis on data to answer practical business problems and provide recommendations and key insights to the business. Mentors and guides junior associates on basic modeling and analytics techniques to solve complex problems.\nModel Deployment & Scaling: Supports efforts to ensure that analytical models and techniques used can be deployed into production. Supports evaluation of the analytical model. Supports the scalability and sustainability of analytical models.\nCode Development & Testing: Writes code to develop the required solution and application features by using the recommended programming language and leveraging business, technical, and data requirements. Test the code using the recommended testing approach.\nProblem Formulation: Translates business problems within one's discipline to data related or mathematical solutions. Identifies what methods (for example, analytics, big data analytics, automation) would provide a solution for the problem. Shares use cases and gives examples to demonstrate how the method would solve the business problem.\nModel Assessment & Validation: Supports model fit testing and statistical inferences to evaluate performance. Assesses the impact of variables and features on model performance.\nData Visualization: Generates appropriate graphical representations of data and model outcomes under guidance. Supports the understanding of customer requirements and designs data representations for simple data sets. Presents to and influences the team using the appropriate frameworks and conveys messages through basic business understanding.\nModels compliance with company policies and procedures and supports company mission, values, and standards of ethics and integrity by incorporating these into the development and implementation of business plans; using the Open Door Policy; and demonstrating and assisting others with how to apply these in executing business processes and practices.\nWhat you'll bring..\nExperience in Analyzing the Complex Problems and translate it into data science algorithms\nExperience in machine learning, supervised and unsupervised: Forecasting, Classification, Data/Text Mining, NLP, Decision Trees, Adaptive Decision Algorithms, Random Forest, Search Algorithms, Neural Networks, Deep Learning Algorithms\nExperience in statistical learning: Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics, Web Analytics, Parametric and Non-parametric models, Regression, Time Series, Dynamic/Causal Model, Statistical Learning, Guided Decisions, Topic Modeling\nExperience with big data analytics - identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in large volumes of data\nStrong Experience with one or more of Python and R\nStrong Experience with big data platforms \u2013 Hadoop (Hive, Pig, Map Reduce, HQL, Scala)\nExperience with Teradata, SQL and relational databases, data warehouse\nYou\u2019ll really wow us if\u2026\nDomain Knowledge of one or more divisions in Retail\nPublished papers or given talks in Data science forums, leading academic and research journals\nHold data science related patents\nExperience with data warehouse platforms\nExperience with GPU/CUDA for computational efficiency\nMinimum Qualifications...\nOutlined below are the required minimum qualifications for this position.
