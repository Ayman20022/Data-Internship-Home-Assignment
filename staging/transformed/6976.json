By building strong capabilities and culture, we accelerate and embed digital transformation. Our people co-create and grow customer-focused solutions that win. We modernize technology and harness value from data and analytics. We build resilience so our clients are ready for tomorrow\u2019s risks and optimize operations for the future. Above all, we work collaboratively with our clients\u2019 leaders, employees, stakeholders, and customers to jointly define, design, and achieve lasting results.\n____\nTHE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nNo two projects are the same. You\u2019ll be working with varied and diverse teams to deliver unique and unprecedented products across industries. The\nPrincipal Data Scientist\nis primarily responsible for advancing our broad capabilities to use and deploy cutting edge data scientific tools and methods in our projects, platforms and products. S/he both anchors our current best practices by designing and building reusable data science assets, and simultaneously works to keep us on the bleeding edge by understanding the very latest and most sophisticated methods and tools for grappling with extremely large scale and complex problems. As a Data Scientist, you will work alongside our partners in the Digital and other practice groups, engage directly with clients to understand their business challenges, and craft appropriate solutions to be delivered by specialists and consultants.\nYour responsibilities will include, for example:\nExploring data and crafting models to answer core business problems that may not have a common blueprint\nGuiding data science consultants on the best path to solving problems in a specific technical domain in which you are the expert\nExplaining, refining, and crafting model insights and architecture to bring stakeholders through the journey of model building\nInventing and pioneer R&D efforts to bring new approaches and state of the art methods to our clients\nCodifying best practice approaches to specific analytical problems in the form of accessible, reusable patterns, templates, and code bases\nLeading efforts to standardize and industrialize solutions such that they can be robustly deployed into production and/or scaled up far beyond the laptop-scale\n____\nYOUR EXPERIENCE & QUALIFICATIONS\nYou are a well-rounded technologist who brings a wealth of real-world experience and a:\nTechnical background in computer science, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics or other quantitative and computational science\nA compelling track record of designing and deploying large scale technical solutions, which deliver tangible, ongoing value:\nDirect experience having built and deployed complex production systems that implement modern, data scientific methods at scale and do so robustly\nComfort in environments where large projects are time-boxed and therefore consequential design decisions may need to be made and acted upon rapidly\nFluency with cluster computing environments and their associated technologies, and a deep understanding of how to balance computational considerations with theoretical properties of potential solutions\nAbility to context-switch, to provide support to dispersed teams which may need an \u201cexpert hacker\u201d to unblock an especially challenging technical obstacle\nDemonstrated fluency in modern programming languages for data science, covering a wide gamut from data storage and engineering frameworks through to machine learning libraries\nExpert knowledge of at least one and probably several core machine learning frameworks, including but not limited to: TensorFlow, Keras/Theano, Torch, Caffe, MxNet; Scikit-Learn, etc.\nDeep understanding of the architecture, performance characteristics and limitations of modern storage and computational frameworks, with experience implementing solutions that leverage: HDFS/Hive; Spark/MLlib; Kafka, etc.\nA history of compelling side projects or contributions to the Open Source community is valued but not required\nSolid theoretical grounding in the mathematical core of the major ideas in data science\nExpert level understanding of a class of modelling or analytical techniques, often supported by Masters- or Doctoral-level research in the subject\nDeep fluency in the mathematical \u2018primitives\u2019 and generalizations of data science \u2013 e.g., expertise in Linear Algebra, and Vector Calculus\nExperience presenting at high-impact data science conferences and solid linkages to the data science community (e.g., via meet-ups, continuing relationships with academics, etc.) is highly valued\nInterest/background in Financial Services, and capital markets in particular; Health and Life Sciences; Consumer, Retail, Energy, or Transportation\n____\nYOUR ATTRIBUTES\nOur team comprises all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. We don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re loud or quiet, funny or serious, introverted or extroverted. We do, however, ask that you have:\nAn undergraduate or advanced degree from a top academic program\nA genuine passion for technology and solving problems\nA pragmatic approach to solutioning and delivery\nExcellent communication skills, both verbal and written\nA clear commitment to creating impactful solutions that solve our clients\u2019 problems\nThe ability to work fluidly and respectfully with our incredibly talented team\nWillingness to travel (when its safe to do so again)", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-03T03:46:53.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Quantitative Systems", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantitative-systems"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
