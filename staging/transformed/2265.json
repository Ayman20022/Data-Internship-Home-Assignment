The company was founded in 2016 by an experienced ad tech marketer and two experienced machine learning experts who had previously worked at Yahoo, Twitter, and BrightRoll. We\u2019re backed by leading early-stage investors including Amplify Partners, Homebrew, and Precursor Ventures. Intellimize intelligently optimizes websites for revenue driven leaders. Our machine learning automatically personalizes the buyer\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. On average, our customers achieve 46% lift. We work with great companies like Drift, Looker, Unilever, Sumo Logic, Tableau, Emburse, and many more.\nWe believe everything we do flows from two things: making our customers wildly successful and having this be the best professional experience of our lives. This company is based on our customers achieving their goals, getting promoted, and getting up on stage saying great things about our work together.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the team has been working fully remotely. While we plan to move back into a San Mateo office once it is safe to do so, the engineering team will continue to embrace a remote-first culture and workflow. We welcome candidates from anywhere in the US or Canada. Our core working hours are centered around the Pacific time zone.\nA Few More Things About Us\nIntellimize optimizes websites to generate more revenue. We use machine learning to automatically optimize each buyer\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. Our unique solution enables experimentation and personalization at an unparalleled scale, and it replaces traditional approaches to optimization such as A/B testing and rules-based personalization. These methods are too slow, require daily attention, and don\u2019t automatically adapt to changes in behavior over time.\nWe are entrepreneurs with deep experience in paid digital media and personalization.\nOur team has experience building massive-scale personalized recommendation systems and machine learning infrastructure at Yahoo, Google, and Quora.\nWe move fast. We are data-driven. We get things done.\nOur customers are true north.\nWe believe in the importance of work/life balance to do your very best work.\nAbout You\nYou have a degree in CS, math, or another highly quantitative field, or you have equivalent experience\nYou understand theory, and you\u2019re also a builder\nYou\u2019re a multiplier: your instinct is to make everyone around you more productive\nYou\u2019re great at self teaching and teaching others\nYou want to work in a startup atmosphere: you adapt quickly, iterate fast, and you communicate clearly, directly, and frequently\nYou\u2019re prefer a \u201clight touch\u201d (but not hands off) approach to project management\nYou have experience with back-end software engineering and/or machine learning\nYou have excellent skills with a general purpose programming language such as Java or C++ (including object oriented design and concurrency)\nYou have experience with scripting in a language such as Python\nYou're familiar with (or have built) service oriented architectures or microservices\nYou either have experience with machine learning or are excited to learn about it; we implement ideas from research papers, and working on some of our core systems requires ML knowledge\nYou have experience with relational and non-relational databases\nYou have experience with web-facing services\nWe\u2019d also love it if you have experience with any of the following:\nREST APIs\nData engineering\nLow latency services\nSystem architecture (working across and defining system boundaries)\nMachine learning at scale\nSpark\nAirflow\nTensorflow\nWeb security\nWhat you will work on\nRole\nHere are a few recent and upcoming projects the team has worked on to give you a sense of the scope of this role\nDesign an ingestion and storage system that allows our customers to integrate with the data in third-party systems\nImplement a data pipeline for a new class of ML models and orchestrate it on Airflow\nDesign an online ML monitoring system that works for batch and streaming models\nAdd infrastructure- and configuration-as-code tooling to existing systems\nBuild the back end for new customer facing features that require complex queries to graph data\nEnsure we continue to offer excellent security for our customers\nWhy us?\nYou get to work on cutting edge, novel ML systems\nAs part of a small team, you will get to improve and own a major part of our systems\nYou\u2019ll work across several systems solving hard problems; as a result, you\u2019ll learn fast and grow your skills tremendously in a short time\nYou\u2019ll be expected to have a big impact; your growth opportunities will be correspondingly large\nYou get to work with an experienced, positive team and help shape the DNA of the company\nYou\u2019ll get competitive salary, equity, and benefits (health, dental, vision, 401k)", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-30T17:07:01.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Intellimize", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellimize"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
