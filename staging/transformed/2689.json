The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team provides a specialization within engineering focused on designing, engineering, evolving, and safely making changes to large-scale distributed systems; these systems are often composed of disparate components which are each individually complex. In the process of that work, they are also responsible for analyzing, repairing, and preventing unexpected issues that emerge from such systems.\nThe SRE Team Has Three Goals\nSet high standards for reliable products at Robinhood.\nArchitect products and infrastructure that encourage and carry out high reliability.\nInspire change across the broader organization to adopt product reliability best practices and high reliability infrastructure.\nWe are seeking an experienced SRE to work with our SRE leadership team to help build, define the vision and roadmap of our newly formed SRE organization. Initially, you will embed with a product engineering team to understand their work, and look for opportunities to bring SRE wisdom to bear.\nYour Day-to-day Will Involve\nCombine software and systems knowledge to engineer high-volume distributed systems in a reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant manner.\nContinually optimize systems and workflows by improving architecture, infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and observability.\nAct as an owner and leader of Robinhood's infrastructure by ensuring project infrastructure needs are met and working proactively with customer teams to help them improve reliability and set best practices.\nProvide mentorship both formally and informally to engineers at Robinhood, define and formalize the architecture design process and guide the overall architectural direction.\nRepresent Robinhood in the technology community (ex: conferences, technical blog posts, etc).\nAbout You\nProficient in one or more programming languages (e.g. Go, Python, Java).\nExperience authoring and operating high-scale services.\nExperience with scalable distributed systems, either built from scratch or on public Cloud (e.g. AWS) primitives.\nA focus on software engineering best practices such as testing, static analysis, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.\nWillingness to learn and use new technologies, and to learn the ins-and-outs of the financial system.\nExtremely data-driven.\nA minimum of 5+ years of industry experience.\nAbility to debug complex systems.\nBonus Points\nFamiliarity of Python/Django or Go\nExperience with high-growth startups\nStrong open source contributions\nTechnologies We Use\nPython, Django/DRF\nGo\nCI/CD and test automation frameworks\nContainer and container orchestration technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes)\nMicroservice-oriented architectures and related OSS technologies (e.g. Kafka, Celery/RabbitMQ, nginx, Redis, Postgres, Airflow, Consul, etc.)\nCloud-native infrastructure (AWS, GCP)\nLinux internals and network configuration and protocols\nInfrastructure as Code and configuration management (Terraform, SaltStack)", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-08-03T01:07:18.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Robinhood", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/robinhood"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": 60, "seniority_level": "Senior"}}
