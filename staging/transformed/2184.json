If you're not keen on flexibility and a \"learn while we go\" mentality, you may get frustrated easily.\nEveryone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty vision. If you prefer a 9-5 job or to rest-and-vest, this job isn't for you.\nAs the very first in-house engineer, you'll be an owner and an operator. If that doesn't excite you, then we're not a good match.\nWe deeply believe teamwork makes the dream work.
