SREs are a blend of pragmatic operators and software craftspeople that apply sound engineering principles, operational discipline, and mature automation to our environments and the Elsevier's production codebases. SREs can specialize in systems, whether it be networking, the Linux kernel, or some more specific interest in containers, observability, scaling, algorithms, or distributed systems.\nElsevier has a complex portfolio of products and services. We have a cloud native, microservices and\u00a0container platform strategy\u00a0which seeks to improve how we deliver quality software to customers at a higher pace. The experiences and expertise that our embedded and consulting SREs have can assist other engineering groups within the company, as well as to Elsevier customers running our software.\nThe SRE model is a specific implementation of DevOps, which has a more specific focus on innovation, application reliability and performance at scale. Fundamental to SRE is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.\nAs an SRE you will:\nPartner with Product Owners\u00a0to agree availability targets that our customers value the most.\nDocument every action\u00a0so your findings turn into repeatable actions\u2013and then into automation.\nMake monitoring and alerting alert on symptoms and not on outages.\nDebug production issues across services and all levels of the stack including real user experience issues.\nBe on a standby rotation to respond to availability incidents and provide support for Product teams with customer incidents.\nLearn from your time on-call\u00a0to prevent incidents from ever happening.\nRun our Infrastructure Platform with Terraform and Kubernetes.\nUse the Infrastructure Platform\u00a0to run your product\u00a0as a first resort and make suggestions to improve the platform as much as possible.\nImprove the deployment process to make it as boring as possible.\nPlan the growth of your product's infrastructure.\nDesign, build and maintain paved road modules that allows products to scale.\nYou may be a fit to this role if you have some of these inclinations\nShare our\u00a0operating principles and work in accordance with those principles.\nYou see challenges from a business and customer perspective.\nYou view problems as an opportunity to improve.\nThat you are a\u00a0systems thinker\u00a0- with a deep understanding of\u00a0the whole and the parts, how products interconnect and feedback loops.\nInvolvement in hiring process - reviewing questionnaires, involved in interviews, qualifying candidates\nAccountability, self awareness, handling conflict in the team and receiving feedback\nMaintaining good relationships with other engineering teams in Elsevier that help improve their products", "employment_type": "FULL_TIME", "date_posted": "2021-07-21T13:40:50.000Z"}, "company": {"name": "Elsevier", "link": "https://nl.linkedin.com/company/elsevier"}, "education": {"required_credential": "bachelor degree"}, "experience": {"months_of_experience": null, "seniority_level": null}}
